## Research Experience
* **Online Research Intern, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)**\
  02/2023 ~ 08/2023\
  Supervisor: Prof. Jinhua Zhao, Prof. Shenhao Wang\
  Project 1: Uncertainty Quantification in Traffic Data Imputation\
  • Utilized graph attention layers and bidirectional recurrent units to capture spatio-temporal traffic data patterns and predicted uncertainty of traffic data.\
  Project 2:Mixture Models for Uncertainty Quantification in Sparse Travel Demand Prediction\
  •	Used mixture models (Laplace, Poisson, Gaussian) to approximate complex travel demand distribution, addressing high zero occurrences.

* **Research Intern, Duke Kunshan University**\
  07/2021 ~ present\
  Supervisor: Prof. Peng Sun, Ph.D.\
  Project 1: A Velocity-based Model in Traffic Flow Prediction\
  •	Conducted evaluations and comparisons among popular traffic flow prediction models (Linear Regression, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest, LSTMs, and GRUs) in a single intersection based on accuracy (RMSE,MAE,R^2).\
  •	Increased 2% accuracy (RMSE) on average by considering the vehicles’ speed in surrounding intersections to adjust the original results.\
  Project 2: A Hybrid Model in Traffic Flow Prediction!\
  •	Combined Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, Wavelet Analysis and Spectral Analysis to design an accurate traffic flow forecasting algorithm.\
  Project 3: Traffic Flow Prediction using Auto-encoder\
  •	Applied Auto-encoder as a dimension reduction technique for large road networks and increased the time efficiency by 27.4% with sacrifice of only 5% accuracy (MSE).\
  •	Provided a comprehensive analysis of trade-off between original data information loss and noises’ filtration from the original data while applying dimension reduction technique.






* **Research Intern, Westlake University**\
  07/2021 ~ 08/2021\
  Supervisor: Prof. Stan Z. Li\
  Project: Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs)\
  • Predicted PPIs based on primary protein structures, using traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods (RNNs) and advanced NLP methods (Transformers).\
  • Increased accuracy by 2% (MSE) in RNNs methods by using the trick of pad sequences.
